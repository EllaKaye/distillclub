# Distill Clib

![Distill Club logo](https://github.com/EllaKaye/distillclub/raw/main/distillclub-400.png)

Distill Club is a way of welcoming people who create websites made with the [{distill}](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) package. For example, the hex logo and a 'Welcome to the #distillClub' message can be tweeted as a response to someone announcing their new site.

The idea was inspired by #xaringanClub, initiated in [a tweet by Dr Silvia CanelÃ³n](https://twitter.com/spcanelon/status/1382081701732626436) for congratulating people on their first [{xaringan}](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/#1) presentation.

The hex logo for Distill Club was similarly inspired by the [Xaringan Club logo](https://github.com/dynastyprocess/graphics/tree/main/xaringanclub), created by [Tan Ho](https://tanho.ca), which in turn was inspired by another of [Silvia's tweets](https://twitter.com/spcanelon/status/1382063172530671617?s=20).

## Sharing (e.g. on Twitter)

This hex logo is absolutely welcome to be shared - especially for welcoming people to the Distill Club! You do not have to tag me while using the image, though I'd appreciate it if you did (if only to see other people's distill websites!). My twitter handle is [@ellamkaye](https://twitter.com/ellamkaye). Please consider including alt-text wherever it's shared!

Suggested alt text: 

> Distill Club hex logo: a pink and dark navy logo featuring the words "Distill Club" and a stylized water droplet emblazoned on a soap bar. Inspired by hex stickers for the distill and Xaringan Club and the Fight Club film soap logo. Logo originally created by Ella Kaye https://github.com/EllaKaye/distillclub and released under CC0.

## Design notes

A hex logo inspired by mashing up [Fight Club's pink soap logo](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/1150388298535995840/) with the [distill hex logo](https://github.com/rstudio/distill/blob/master/man/figures/logo.png) (similar to the Xaringan Club hex sticker).

Font is [Fight This](https://www.dafont.com/fight-this.font) which seems to be accurate to the movie's text styles.

## Versions

The `distillclub.png` and `distillclub.svg` files are large. The `distillclub-text-as-curve.svg` file has the text saved as curves, and thus can be used without having the Fight This font installed on your computer.

Smaller png versions, `distillclub-600.png`, `distillclub-400.png` and `distillclub-200.png` are included, which are respectively 600px, 400px and 200px wide.
